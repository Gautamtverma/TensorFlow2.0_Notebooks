# TensorFlow 2.0 Tutorial



Welcome to my TensorFlow 2.0 tutorial.
Recently, Google released (the alpha version of) TensorFlow 2.0. As I'm trying to move from the 1.x and lern the new, I'll upload all my progresses on this repo.

The training of models is based on TensorFlow's **eager execution** method. I'll try to minimize referencese to Keras.



## Contents:

- **TensorFlow2.0_01_basic_Classifier**:  implementation of a feed forward Classifier with simple full-Batch Gradient Descent.

- **TensorFlow2.0_02_MiniBatch_Gradient_Descent**:  implementation of Mini-Batch Gradient Descent.



## Coming Soon:

- Autoencoder for dimensionality reduction**:  how to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset with a stacked Autoencoder.

- How to save and restore models.

- Regression tasks

- Convolutional Neural Networks
